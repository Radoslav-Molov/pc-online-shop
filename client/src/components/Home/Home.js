                Learning how to build a PC is easier than you might think. The
                process mostly involves screwing in the right screws and
                connecting the right cables, so as long as you're careful with
                your components and take the proper safety precautions, you can
                build your own PC. We've broken down the process into a series
                of easy-to-follow steps. From gathering your components to
                putting on the finishing touches, our guide will walk you
                through how to easily build a PC.

                Workstation vs Gaming PC – What’s the Difference
              </Card.Title>
              <Card.Text>
                Have you ever wondered what makes one computer a ‘Workstation’
                and another, a ‘Gaming’ PC? Surely, it can’t just be the RGB (or
                lack thereof). You often hear manufacturers promote their latest
                product as ‘the best in the gaming market,’ but then you see
                them listed in professional setups. What’s that about? The world
                of PC hardware includes a vast array of terminology. Hence,
                finding minor differences between various types of hardware,
                like those used in workstations and/or gaming PCs, can get
                really confusing at times.
